# hw-scraper
An article scraping web app which allows users to save and comment on articles

### How to Use
Simply hit the "Scrape Articles" button, and a number of desktop computer reviews will be scraped from PCMag.com's desktop review section. Each article is populated onto the page with a corresponding title, link, and brief "bottom line" description.

Once the scraped articles are populated onto the page, the user can elect to save relevant or interesting articles into their library by selecting the "Save" button. Viewing saved articles will allow users to add notes to each saved article.
